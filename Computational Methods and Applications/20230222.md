## interpolation vs curve fitting
interpolation - curve must pass through all the points
curve fitting - curve need not pass through all the points

ill confition - scale large: eigen value 1000 - matrices difficult to deal with
chebyshev proof-induction
next week submit scribe upto slide 13.

coding assignment
1. plot scatter of input points as well as functions
2. try to plot taylor series poly too to compare; can use scipy linalg
5. use recursive property (slide)
6. print out a upper triang matrix, see of everything on diag non0, others close to 0 (~e-60)
7. fourier approximations are periodic. but e^x is not periodic. what's the catch? we assume e^x is 2pi periodic (-pi to pi). for aperiodic functions there's fourier transform.
8. ...later topic

for integration can use scipy
