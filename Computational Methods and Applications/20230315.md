# ODE
- Lotka-Volterra eqn
- Cauchy Problem
- Euler method
  - discretise the fn. somehow solve for discrete. interpolate
- stability on unbounded intervals
- higher order methods
  - runge-kutta method

**Excercises**

----
1. can use scipy interpolate if needed, else can use polynomial
2. same, but bkwd
3. `funcanimation`
5. keep some limit(boundary condn) so that denominator never become 0. Like some radius of shpherical obj. dont apply on denom directly, apply on square part of denom. other 1 in denom is part of unit vector for numer


next week, no new code, discussion wk 3 and 4.
