------------
* Python
* Matplotlib
### Discrete Distributions
- converting discrete distribution to continuous by using indicator variable
## Monte Carlo
rely on repeated random sampling
- estimating pi
  - 10^6 throws to get good esimate
  - why people go to 22/7 when random is there?

scipy.stats

------
assignment
* submissions for next 2 assignments on 28th
* typed report for assignment - highlight key points , some input output - technique - pdf
* comment : what this fn does
------
1. convert to log and do.
2. -ve, float, string -> exception. write implementation in report;; print object - stringify
3. no need to implement discrete sampling, can use scipy.stats
4. mapping (a,b) = 1/4 (b,c) = 1/4 ...next word, prob.
