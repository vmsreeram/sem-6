limit: $\forall \epsilon>0 \exists n_\epsilon,$ s.t $\forall n \ge n_\epsilon |a_n-a|\le\epsilon$

- difference btw 2 consecutive $x^k$.
- for vector, can use norm.
  - norm : $|| x ||_p = (\Sigma^n_{i=1} |x_i|^p)^{1/p}$
  - $||x||_\infty$ diff btw largest
- it ususally takes $O(1/\epsilon)$ num iter to solve such convergence prblm. some cases log(1/eps)
- non singular : non 0 det. rank:full rank
- slide 7, given it is diafonally dominant by row, prove that javobi method converges.

- inverse computation is $O(n^3)$

## assignment
1. .
   - getitem(self,index), setitem(self,index)
   - declare as objects and private funct as private ( __ )(?)
     - `__f()` can't be accessed as `classobjectname.__f(.)`. It's private.
2. .
   - can use `random` to sample element.
   - row echelon form is an upper triangle matrix
     - can do using elementary row operations. 
3. .
   - for each val of iteration how close (by showing error). could do rnd sampling of 1000 matrices and show how many converge?
4. .
   - implementation
   - can give $\LaTeX$ to Matplotlib
   - implement as given in the slide
5. .
   - use `funcanimation()` <!--  -->
