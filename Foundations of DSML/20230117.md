# Foundation of Data Science and Machine Learning
- data converted to vector in euclidian space
  - because algorithms deal with numbers
    - geometry becomes surprisingly useful
  - say data is email, it can be represented as frequency vector/ relative freq vec/ ...
    - Dimension : no. of words in dictionary
  - search engine - similar method - similar people similar interests
- line of separation : $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{x} = b$
- how to find line of separation, given the points are linearly separable?
- classic algorithm 
  - start by taking the convex hull (smallest convex set (for any 2 points in the set, the line joining them also is inside the set) containing all those points) of class 1 points and class 2 points. 
  - find the smallest line segment that connects these two convex hulls.
  - its bisector will work the best.
    - maximum margin separator
