Digital
- Not analog
  - analog : continuous in time & ampl
- digital - digit

- system - takes i/p in some process and gives o/p
- digital : quantized
- digital system is an approx of analog sys (abstraction)
  - easier to implement/construct
  - noise tolerant

- Binary systems - most common

Synthesis
- construction
- "the combination of components to create a whole"

in this course
- take abstract high level specifications and give its detailed implementation (digital system)
- eg Phone with multiple unlock systems (faceID, touchID)
  - this is abstract
    - missing details : how many cores, what kind of cores, input output, what kind of camera, what kind of sensor
    - spec is incomplete - after how long does it unlock
  - system level :: finer details : components : camera,fingerprint sensor, 5G transceiver;
  - h/w s/w co-design ; design space explanation
  - high level :: face-> h/w acclerator, fingerprint -> s/w 
  * system synthesis : system level -> high level spec (algorithm)
  * high level sysnthesis : high level spec -> behavioural level spec (memory unit (SRAM arrays) components)
  * behavioural synthesis : behavioural level spec -> Register Transfer Level (RTL) (timing wrt clock cycles)
  * logic synthesis : RTL -> Gate Level (AND, OR, NOT, EX-OR, D-FlipFlops, wires)
  * layout synthesis  : Gate Level -> Layout    "place & route"
  * .. : Layout -> fabrication
