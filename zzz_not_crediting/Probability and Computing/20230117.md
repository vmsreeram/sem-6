# Probability and Computing

Applications
1. Randomized Algorithm 
   1. Monte Carlo
   2. Las Vegas
2. Average case analysis of a deterministic algorithm

### Problem
**Input :** An array $A$ of $n$ integers (at least one of them is odd).

**Output :** Location of any one odd integer in $A$.

***Alg 1 : Linear search*** 
1. It always gives a correct answer.
2. Worst case running time $n$ $\equiv$ $O(n)$.
3. Average case:
    - $\frac{1}{n} + \frac{2}{n} + ... + \frac{n}{n}  = \frac{n}{2}$
    - `  loc=1,p=1/n;  loc=2,p=1/n;...     loc=n,p=1/n  `

### Problem
**Input :** An array $A$ of $n$ integers (~exactly~ almost half of them is odd).

**Output :** Location of any one odd integer in $A$.

***Alg 1 : Linear search*** 
1. It always gives a correct answer.
2. Worst case running time $n/2$ $\equiv$ $O(n)$. (same for at least half of them is odd)
3. Average case:
    - X : random variable = # of comparisons
      - P(X = 1) = 1/2        (A[1] is odd)
      - P(X = 2) = (1/2)^2    (A[1] is even and A[2] is odd)
      - P(X = i) = (1/2)^i    (i $\in$ {1,2,...,n-1})
    - We looking for XP(X)
    - $\approxeq \Sigma_{i=1}^{n} \frac{i}{2^i}  \approx \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{i}{2^i}$
    - (AGP) 
    - inf series sum = 2
    - ans = 2-eps

***Alg 2 : Randomised : Random sample without replacement*** 
   - pick i $\in$ [n] u.a.r.     {[n] = {1,2,...,n}  u.a.r = uniformly at random}
   - if A[i] is odd, 
     - return i
   - else
     - repeat i on A $\setminus$ {i}
1. This algo will terminate, and worst case running time is n/2.
2. Average
    - X : RV = # trials
    - 
    - 111 ... 000
    - n/2     n/2
    - 
    - P(X = 1) = 1/2
    - P(X = 2) = (1/2)^2    (1st pick is even and 2nd pick is odd)
    - P(X = i) = (1/2)^i    (i $\in$ {1,2,...,n-1})
    - Ans : 2
    - 
    - 1010...0101
    - #1 = n/2
    - 
    - P(X = 1) = 1/2
    - P(X = 2) = (1/2)^2    (1st pick is even and 2nd pick is odd)
    - P(X = i) = (1/2)^i    (i $\in$ {1,2,...,n-1})
    - Ans : 2
    - 
    - 000...01
    - #1 = 1
    - 
    - P(X = 1) = 1/n
    - P(X = 2) = (1 - 1/n) * (1/n)
    - P(X = i) = (1 - 1/n)^(i-1) * (1/n)
    - Ans : n
-----
* Average running time can also be asked for specific input
* Randomised algo is helpful in these cases where the adversary can't trick.

### Problem
return YES if there is at least an odd number, NO if all are even
given GPU that compute inner product very fast.
