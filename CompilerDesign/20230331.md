```c++
for(int i=100;i>1;i--)
    for(int j=i-1;j>1;j--)
        if(a[j]>a[i]) {
            temp=a[j];
        //       ^--- (1)
            a[j]=a[i];
        //  ^--- (2)  
            a[j]=temp;
        }
// intermediate code for (1) and (2) will have 4*j
t1 = 4*j
t2 = a[t1]
...

// all subsequent 4*j may be replaced with t1
/* This is called copy propogation */
```
<u>**Basic block**</u> is sequence of instructions those are executed together.


1. Copy propogation : see above eg.
2. Constant propogation
```c
t1 = 5
t3 = t1 + t5
// can be replaced by
t3 = 5 + t5
```
3. Constant folding
```c
t1 = 5
t5 = 20
t3 = t1 + t5
// can be replaced by
t3 = 25
```
4. Strength reduction
```c
// same operator, addition takes less time, left shift takes even less time
```
5. Global common subexpression
6. Elimination

<u>Intermediate code for 1st code</u>
```c
// check for correctness
B1: i=100
B2: t1=i>1
false
    B3: stop
true
    B4:
    j=i-1
    t1=4*j
    t2=a[t1]
    t3=4*i
    t4=a[t3]
    t5=t2>t4
    false
        B5:
        j=j-1
        t6=j>1
        true
            goto B4
    true
        ...
```
