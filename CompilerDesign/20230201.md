- automata of lex?
- regex [0-9]+[.][0-9]+ ...
- table-- [1][0] => on state 1, input 0 : nrows=nstates, ncols=atmax256

- in lab, can use c/c++ to make expression tree
  - you have 
    - lex file, 
    - yacc file, 
    - symbol table in c/c++, => easy in c++ like stl map
    - syntax tree in c/c++, 
    - code generation in c/c++
- to have +/- having lower precedence than *//, we need to have +/- in the top of the (parse) tree.
  - so we can modify grammar in such a way that
    - E -> E+T | E-T | T
    - T -> T*F | T/F | F
    - F -> 0|1|...|9
  - eg. write a production for 2*3+5
    - E -> E1+T2
    - E1 -> T1
    - T1 -> F1
    - F1 -> 5
    - T2 -> T3*F2
    - T3 -> F3
    - F3 -> 3
    - F2 -> 2
      - This is not an ambiguous grammar - as only one parse tree
