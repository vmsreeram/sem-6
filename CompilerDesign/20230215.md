## First and Follow
Follow of a non terminal is a set containing the terminals symbol that **immediately** follows that non terminal.
????????
A ==>+ a                        FIRST(A) contains a
S ==>+ $\alpha$ A b $\beta$     FOLLOW(A) contains b


First of non terminal is a set containing the terminals you get 1st when you split that (production) non terminal.
????????
S ==>+ xBx$\beta$

E -> E+T | E-T | T
T -> T*F | T/F | F
F -> id | ( E )

first of E contains id, (
FOLLOW of E contains +, -, )
(E -> E+T->E+T*F)
....

E   -> TE'
E'  -> +TE' | -TE' | $\epsilon$
T   -> FT'
T'  -> *FT' | /FT' | $\epsilon$
F   -> id | ( E )

FIRST(T') = {*, /, $\epsilon$}
....
