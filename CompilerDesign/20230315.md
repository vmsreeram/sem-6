## Semantic analysis
- static semantics
  - types match
  - num and type of params are same in both decl and use
  - check declared before use
- dynamic semantics
  - int overflow
  - array index is within valid lims 
  - overflow due to `*`
- ...
### Attribute Grammar
### Synthesised and inherited attributes
- synthesised and inherited
- synthesised: computed in bottom up fashion from leaves upwards
  - always syth from attribute values of childred
  - leaves have syn attribs init from lexical analyser (can't be modified)
  - S-attributed grammar(SAG)
  - yacc permit only SAGs
- inherited: flow down from the parent or siblings to the node in question
