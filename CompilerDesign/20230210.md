- in yacc if you dont give rules it'll accept all

- left most derivation : replace the leftmost **non** terminal first
- right most derivation : replace the rightmost **non** terminal first

- can write cfg for $W$c$W^R$ [S-> aSa|bSb|c], but can't for $W$c$W$ [$W$ $\in$ $\{a,b\}^*$], however TuringMachine can solve it.

* left recursive grammar - if it has non terminal $A$ such that there is a derivation $A{\Rightarrow}^+ A \color{red}{\alpha}$ for some string $\color{red}{\alpha}$.
  * ${\Rightarrow}^+$ means derive in one or more steps
  * $A\rightarrow A \color{red}{\alpha} |  \color{orange}{\beta}$
  * Q. modify the above grammar suxk that there is no left recursion.
    * $A\Rightarrow\beta B$
    * $B\Rightarrow\alpha B | \epsilon$ 
    * no left recursion here because both rules's rhs does not begin with non terminal.
    * this is right recursive
  * Eliminate immediate left recursion in grammar
