## Intermediate Code Generation
all these are from [dragon book](dragon%20compiler.pdf) chapter 6.
- $a^n b^n c^n$ can be accepted by **attributed grammar** (correct ans) and turing machine
- Need of intermediate code (IR - intermediate representation): Intermediate code is independent of src lang and targ machine. So it can be used for variety of ...
- the most widely used IR in commercial .. is static single ...
- we saw 3 address code as IR in a prev lec.
- IR introduces new variables, temorarily created by the intermediate code generator.

- Three address code: address can be a name, constant, compiler generated temporary.
- Common 3 addr code stmts
  - x=y
  - x=op y (unary minus)
  - x=y op z (binary arithmetic ot logical)
  - goto L
  - if x goto L
  - if false x goto L
  - if x relop y goto L (relop: <,<=,..)
  - procedure calls 
    - param x1
    - param x2
    - ...
    - param xn
    - call p,n
  - loop
    - do i = i+1 while (a[i] < n)
- another way of looking at 3 addr code: quadraple
- another way of looking at 3 addr code: triples
## Static single assignment form (SSA Form)
- facilitates certain code optimisations
- used in commercial compilers like llvm gcc?
- each var is assigned only once, hence term *static single assignment*.
- SSA uses $\phi$ func to combine 2 def of a var coming through diff ctrl paths
- Three address code $\impliedby\implies$SSA Form
