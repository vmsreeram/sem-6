## Top down parsing
- (no left recursion in CFG) ???????? textbook
- FIRST and FOLLOW
- LL(K)
  - Left to right scan of input
  - Left most derivaton
  - K -- Number of look ahead symbols
ACTION and GOTO
action is for non terminal
goto is for terminal

---
## Bottom up parsing
it is called LR
- (no? left recursion in CFG) ???????? textbook
  - Left to right scan of input
  - Right most derivation in reverse
- **Handle** : substring that matches the body of a production and whose reduction represents one step alonf the reverse of a rightmist derivation
- if S $\Rightarrow$ $\alpha$ A $w$ $\Rightarrow$ $\alpha$ $\beta$ $w$ then
  - string $\beta$ followed by $\alpha$ is a **handle**.
  - $w$ contains only terminal symbols

### Stack and Handle
- with help of stack handle will appear on top of stack
- handle is right hand side of a prodution
