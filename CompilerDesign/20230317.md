- strictly typed lang, non 
## intermediate code generation; multiple levels of IR
- you can have a 3 address code from intermediate code?
- its a dag (why? (directed acyclic graph))
- made using temporary variable

```
   x = a+a*(b-c)+(b-c)*d
     t1=b-c
     t2=a*t1
     t3=a+t2
     t4=t1*d
     (x = )t5 =t4+t3
```
- ^^^this is one possible intermediate code^^^
- benefit: b-c is computed only once in intermediate code. in expr it is done twice
- instead of putting into temp var we can also use array location
- diff kinds of optimisation like deadcode elimination
