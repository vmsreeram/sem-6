## Components of compilers
1. Lexical Analysis
   - NFA DFA CFG
2. Parser C Syntax Analysis
3. Semantic Analysis
   - Syntax is correct, but not correct. eg. her/he, float div for int (some lang will not allow)
4. intermediate code generation
   - in between hardware and front-end
5. Code Optimization
6. Code Generation


### Lexical Analysis
- theoretically done using regular expression
- NFA DFA CFG
- tokenize x = c + d/2 to operator, var, constant, keyword, ...
- Create symbol table

### Syntax Analysis
- syntax tree/expression tree
- also uses intermediate code ~ static single assignment code
