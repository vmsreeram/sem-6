* [`Discussion`] min, max no. of rows for left outer join/right outer join/full outer join of two tables of nrows 3 and 5?
### 5. Set operations
- Union ($\cup$): $R\cup S$ returns **tuples** that appear in either R or in S
  - Union compatible
    - same no. of attributes
    - domain attributes **appear in same order**
      - if not, we got to project it and change order
```sql
(SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE ..) UNION (SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE ..)
```
- Intersection ($\cap$)
```sql
(SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE ..) INTERSECT (SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE ..)
```

**#** When you do set operation, duplicates are removed, but when you do join, duplicates aren't removed.

- Set Difference ($-$): $R-S$ returns all tuples that appear in R but not in S
  - union compatible
```sql
(SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE ..) EXCEPT ALL (SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE ..)
```

- Division $(/)$: consider 2 relations R(x,y) and S(y)
  - $R/S$ : set of x for every y in S, there is a (x,y) in R.

### 6. Genralised projection
- allow arithmetic operation in project operation
- $\pi_{F_1,F_2}(E)$ extract columns of a relation/expression and apply the arithmetic expressions $F_1$ and $F_2$, involving constant and attributes in the schema
  
    $\Pi_{\text{name,salary/12}}\text{(instructor)}$

### 7. Aggregate Function $(\small{G1,...,G_n\gamma F_1(A_1),...,F_n(A_n)} \large{(R)})$

Find no. of courses offered in 2018

$\gamma_{count} \sigma_{year=2018}(courses)$

### Null value
unknown or not exist

```
arithmetic operation with null = null

logical operations
----
null OR true    = true
null OR false   = null
null OR null    = null

null AND true   = null
null AND false  = false
null AND null   = null

NOT null        = null
