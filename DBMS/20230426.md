## Precedence Graph (checking for serializability)
- Graph $G = (V,E)$ where each transaction becomes a node in $V$
- Edge $T_i \rightarrow T_j$
  - If $T_i$ execute write(Q) before $T_j$ execute read(Q).
  - If $T_i$ execute read(Q) before $T_j$ execute write(Q).
  - If $T_i$ execute write(Q) before $T_j$ execute write(Q).
- serializability (?)
## Isolation and Atomicity

- Recoverable schedule - if $T_i$ reads data before $T_j$, then $T_i$ commits first.
- Cascade rollback
- Cascadeless schedule
  - If $T_j$ reads data written by $T_i$, $T_i$  commits before $T_j$ reads

## Isolation and Atomicity
- Serializable
- Repeatable read allows reading **only**  committed data, no other transaction is allowed to update a data in between two reads of the data item by a transaction.
- Read committed allows reading **only**  committed data
- Read uncommitted allows reading uncommitted data
- Phantom read: data is not currently there in the system, but some transaction is trying to update the value (?)
- RW Conflict: i'm trying to read a committed val, will not lead to inconsistent state, but some updation happened in between (some other transaction wrote) (?)
