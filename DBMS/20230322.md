## Indexing
- disk, circular concentric tracks ~ data stored in this, tracks are also divided ~ block?
- why do we need indexing?
  - data records are stored into disk often in sorted order
  - accessing disk is costly operation
  - searching for a particular entry: Sequential scan
    - reading 1000 blocks : 10s
    - for 10k tuples we need 1000 blocks
  - these are called random access
  - super slow.
  - Index file: (search key, pointer)
  - Efficient access to data
  - in index file we can have 1st entry and its pointer.
  - we can look at index file when we search for particular entry by bringing it to main memory.
  - we get which block the desired entry is at. then we can search that block.
  - in effect 2 block access (if index file fits in one block).
  - searching with indexing 1000 blocks : 10ms
## Categorisation of Indices (based on file order)
- data can only be stored in one specific order
  - cluster index: search key in the index consider given order of the file
    - ie, the attribute in which the file is already ordered.
    - primary index: search keys are unique
  - non-cluster index: search keys in the index has different order from the file order. also called secondary index.
    - all names (see slide) are included in the index table for non-cluster index, otherwise we can not search.
- Sparse index (Based on no. of seach keys)
- Single level index
