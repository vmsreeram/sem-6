## Discussion

## Trigger [5.3 Triggers 207]
- method executed by dbms automatically in response to specific changes in database
  - event - insert, delete, or update (point of event - before/after)
  - condition
  - action - if condition is true
- Note: for selection no trigger is required, because no change.
----
* Updation is there, so we have to use procedure -- trigger is a procedure. It has event as one transaction,conditon as another, action as another (?)
* in this paricular case it doesn't return a value
* typically, is cases where more than one update is there, point of event is usually `before`.
* most often point of event should be before.
  * in account banking scenario, if point of event is `after`, the atomicity of transaction is lost.
* used to preserve referential/general constraint
  * like deleting all those info (in other tables) which have this as foreign key to delete this.
* also used to maintain (materialised?) view
* Advantages
  1. Flexibility in capturing integrity constraint
  2. Gathering statistics on table access and modification
  3. Gathering logs on security check
* Disadvantage
  1. Can lead to trigger-chain - inefficient: trigger can call another, that call another one ,... have to wait till all the updates done.

## Accessing DB from Application
- Dynamic SQL
  - connect to db server
  - allow to construct quert within program body as char string
  - submit wuery at runtime
  - retrieve results - a tuple at a time
  - python, jdbc
