## Relational Database Design
- measure how good (in terms of quality) is the design.
- top-down
- Goal of design: info preservation, minimise redundancy
- Refinment of relational model

### Good features of relational database design
1. clear semantics of attributes 
   1. each relation clearly idenetify a real world object
   2. avoid grouping multiple attributes from diff entity type
2. reducing redundant info
   1. insertion anomalies
   2. deletion anomalies: if only one prof for a dep, deleting that entry is deleting whole info of that dep
   3. update anomalies: missing some tuple while updating (because we have redundant info in multiple tuples) - cause inconsistency.
3. Reducing NULL vals in tuples
   1. reducung the waste of space
   2. reducing ambiguous info
4. Disallowing the possibility of spurious tuple
   1. lossless decomposition 
   $$\Pi_{R1}(r) \Join \Pi_{R2}(r)=r$$
   2. spurious tuple: tuples that gets generated when we join that were not at all part of initial (unsplit) table.

### Functional depedency
(see slide 5, Relational Database Design)
- generalise the concept of key
- notation
