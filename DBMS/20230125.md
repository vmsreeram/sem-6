## Advanced Features
* Class hierarchy among entities
  * Overlapping / disjoint 
    * employee is a specialisation of `person` with specific attribute `salary`, student is a specialisation of `person` with specific attribute `tot_credits`. 
    * all the instances under employee will be either instructor or secratary. 
  * Partial/total constraint specialisation
    * total could be overlapping/disjoint
    * partial - some do not appear in any of the child classes?
* Aggregation
  * relationships as higher level entities
    * one instructor can have multiple projects and also multiple students (one to many relations)
* Design issues with ER models
  * entity vs attribute
  * entity vs relationship
  * binary vs ternary relationship
    * binary is always better
