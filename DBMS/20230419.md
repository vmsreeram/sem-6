## Query Optimization
- estimating the cost of each eval plan and choose the one with least cost

## Equivalent Relational Expressions
- Two relational expressions are <u>**equivalent**</u> if they generate the same set of o/p tuples on every legal db instance.
- Equivalence rules ($E$ - expr, $L$ - list of attributes, $\theta$ - predicates)
    1. Cascading property of selection 
    $$\sigma_{\theta_1 \land \theta_2} (E) \equiv \sigma_{\theta_1}(\sigma_{\theta_2}(E))$$
    2. Selection is commutative 
    $$\sigma_{\theta_2}(\sigma_{\theta_1}(E)) \equiv \sigma_{\theta_1}(\sigma_{\theta_2}(E))$$
    3. Projection on list of attributes
    $$\Pi_{L_1}(\Pi_{L_2}(...(\Pi_{L_n}(E))...))\equiv \Pi_{L_1}(E)$$
    4. Selection on cartesian product and theta join
    $$\sigma_{\theta}(E_1\times E_2) \equiv E_1 \bowtie_\theta E_2$$
    $$\sigma_{\theta_1}(E_1\bowtie_{\theta_2} E_2) \equiv E_1 \bowtie_{\theta_1\land \theta_2} E_2$$
    6. Natural joins and $\theta$ joins are associative
    (see slides)
    8. Distribution of selection over theta-joins
    (see slides)
    * is this distribution applicable for left or right outer joins 
      * $\texttt{yes?}$
    9. Distribution of projection on theta-joins
    10. Distribution of selection on outer-joins
