## Hash Index
- in memory index
- distribute records into diff bkts using hash fn h.
- insertion
  - apply hash fn to search key k
  - h(k) is the mem addr to look up
  - overflow bkt (linked list)
- static & dynamic hashing
- can not support range queries
- disadv:
  - skewed data - so many overflow bkts - almost reaching linear scan complexity
- we have to choose hash fn in such a way that we get it as nearly uniform.

## Bitmap Index
- an array of bit to represent presence/absence of search key in records
- efficient for queries with multiple keys
```
    recordnum|gender
    ---------|------
        0    |  m
        1    |  f
        2    |  f
        3    |  m
        4    |  f

    bitmap for gender
    -----------------
        m 10010
        f 01101
```
- if every value is unique it is primary key; no need to do bitmap
- so sometimes we use it on top of B-Tree

# Query Processing
- optimizer
- linear scan
- sync time $t_s$; transfer time $t_T$
- complexity for search on non-key
