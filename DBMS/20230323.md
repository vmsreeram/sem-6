1.Say set of functional dependencies is
```
    F = {
        P   ->  LCA
        LC  ->  AP
        A   ->  C
    }
```
i. How do you make table that is at least in 3NF?\
ii. How do you make table that is at least in BCNF?\
**<u>Ans</u>**\
Candidate key: P, LC, AL. (checked that we can reach all of them)\
((So C is prime attibute))?\
..checking table with all attributes is in 3NF or not..\
....\
So, this is the table
<u>P</u>|L|C|A
--------|-|-|-

It is in 3NF.


LCA | PLA | AC is in BCNF (?)

<u>LC</u>P | <u>P</u>LA | <u>A</u>C is in 3nf (?)
we may get multiple different tables.
- find minimal form
- remove transitivity
- ...
- it will be in 3NF
- some cases it may also satisfy BCNF

-----------
<u>Test 2</u>\
set of funct dependencies will be given.\
create set of tables satisfying whatever asked 


some cases we have to create additional table if we cant put candidate key ???????? discussed in class

**Topics will be till normal form, quiz 1 topics not there**

# [`theory`]
## handling updates in data file
Insert
- no changes in index if a record is added at the end of an existing block
- overflow block
- this is not the case if the block is full.
- in those cases we create a new block

Delete
- no change if search key of deleted record is not in index
