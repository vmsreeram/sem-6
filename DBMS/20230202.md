* Total participation (indicated by double line): every entity in the entity set participates in at least one relationship in the relationship set
* arrow means one. line means many.
    * $\leftarrow\Diamond\rightarrow$ one to one
      * use 1 table if ***one to one*** & ***total participation*** from instructor side,
        * table (`courseid`,`instructorid`,`cname`,`iaddress`,...,)
    * $-\ \Diamond\ -$ many to many
      * use 3 different tables
        * course (`courseid`,`name`...)
        * instructor (`instructorid`,`address`,...)
        * course_instructor (`courseid`,`instructorid`)
    * $-\ \Diamond\rightarrow$ many to one
* if any side of a relation is `many`, we can't take anything from that side (the ID of that side )as primary key.
* all these one to one many to .. are represented in relational model using foreign keys?
