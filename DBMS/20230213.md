## Rewiting Queries
- which construct is more efficient?
  - nested/intersect/join/...

Convert this sql query to rel algebra
```SQL
SELECT A FROM B WHERE C=D AND E=F 
INTERSECT
SELECT A FROM B WHERE C1=D1 AND E1=F1
```
$\Pi_{A}\sigma_{C=D, E=F}(B) \cap \Pi_{A}\sigma_{C1=D1, E1=F1}(B)$


Convert this sql query to rel algebra
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT course.id FROM section WHERE C=D AND E=F AND course.id IN (  
                    SELECT course.id 
                    FROM section
                    WHERE C1=D1 AND E1=F1  )
```
?????
$\Pi_{course.id}\sigma_{(C=D, E=F) \wedge \Pi_{course.id}\sigma_{C1=D1, E1=F1}(B)}(section)$

# Relational Calculus
- describe set of answers based on ***first order predicate calculus***
  - AND $\wedge$, OR, NOT, $\exist$, $\forall$
- Codd's theorem
- any query in a language is expressible using relational calculus
  - the language is ***relationally complete***.
- 2 variants
  - tuple relational calculus
  - domain relational calculus
## Tuple relational calculus
- T is a tuple variable - tuples of a relation as variables $\{(T) | P(T)\}$
  - T : free variable $\rightsquigarrow$ can take tuple from any table
- P(T) is the predicate on variable - true if satisfies
  - eg. $\{(T)|T \in inst \wedge T.sal>90000\}$
    - $T.sal>90000$ is a formula
    - $T \in inst$ is also a formula
