## ER model - Relational model
* entity set -> table
  * composite attribute
    * student
      * name
        * fname
        * lname
      * id
    * will be made as table student: id|fname|lname
    * .
    * because (below fig slide 10) is a weak entity set, we have to put courseid also in table of section.
  * **descriptive attribute** to relation: which (attempt, grade, year) exist only when both course and student are there, cant go to either's table. they go to relation's table (above fig slide 11)
  * (below right fig slide 11): use `as` (alias): use same table in the relation multiple times
  * (below fig sl 11): table for sec_course is identical to the table of section.
  * total participation? (sl 12)
    * many to one from student to dept
    * in this case, total participation means student will always have an associated dept
    * student id is enough to distinguish each tuple in the row. so no need to have {stdid,deptid} as primkey.
    * find out whether you really require a seaparate table. in this case, we can combine the tables. 
    * if i remove total participation constraint (one stud will be asso with one and only one dept), will the same hold? (no?)
  * class hierarchy
    * ISA => is a
    * include (staff )id for lower level
    * include all attributes from higher level for lower level
    * which of wbove 2 depend on type of most often queries
