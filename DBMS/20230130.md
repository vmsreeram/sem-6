## Relational Model
- Collection of relations (2D arr of rows&cols, single valued entries, no dup rows)
- rows are also called tuples
- schema: database schema, relational schema
  - in slide 4, relational schema is given as eg.
    - department(`dep_name`:String,`building`:String,`budget`:Integer)
  - snapshot of schema and particular set of value at a particular time is called **instance**.
  - **domain**: range of values a particular attribute can take. This can change over time.
  - **Tuple**: One record
- Integrity Constraints
  - **Domain constraint**: we put constraint over domain
    - atomic and null value
      - primary key by default assign NOT NULL constraint
      - atomic: indivisible(?)
      - consider table : `dep_name`(Primary key), `building`, `phNo`. Say entries are (d1,b1,p1); (d2,b1,p2). If d1 has another phone number p3, we can't insert (d1,b1,p3) as `dep_name` is primary key.
        - make all attributes together as primary key?
    - unique value
      - eg primary key
  - **Super Key**: set of one or multiple attributes that allows to identify the tuple uniquely in the relation. eg {`dep_name`,`phNo`},{`dep_name`}, ... (any combination with unique key)
  - **Candidate key**: minimal Super Key. eg. `dep_name`
  - **Primary Key**: Candidate key chosen by DBA based on infrequent updates on candidate key. eg. `dep_name`
    - disc mapping for table gets changed when primary key valiue of some tuple is changed. That's why we choose most stable candidate key as primary key.
  - **Foreign key constraints**: check consistency of data
    - Arrow: ***referencing table*** $\longrightarrow$ ***referred table***
  - **General constraints**: avoid errors during modification
    - like `budget` should not be -ve
