---------------
* Database - collection of interrelated data
* DBMS - tool to create and manage databases
* Applications
  * file system?

Relational database - fancy name for table
- subject of table : title of a column

### Why database
* easy to deploy & access
* adaptive to new applications/tech changes

### Advantage of DB over file systems
* DB has data description and data relation
  * Description : type of subject?
  * Can show the user just the structure of table, by hiding actual data
* Redundancy and inconsistancy
  * Say if we don't have some data, then the next val be inconsistant in file sys based implementation
  * If we have multiple tables, if we update in one table, it won't get updated in other tables (file sys is hierarchical)
    * In relDB we can specify that this column is always coming from that table
    * "Foreign key"?
