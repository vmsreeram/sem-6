## 1NF : 1$^{st}$ Normal Form
- disallow relations withing relations or multi-valued attribute.
- ...
## 2NF : 2$^{nd}$ Normal Form
- Fully functional dependency.
  - removal of an attribute A from X fails too preserve (X-A)$\to$Y
- **Prime attribute**: member of candidate key
- Every non-prime attribute A in R is fully functinally dependent on each candidate key of R.
## 3NF : 3$^{rd}$ Normal Form
- Every non-prime attribute A in R is fully functionally dependent on each candidate key of R (2NF).
- No nonprime attribute of R is transitively dependent on the primary key.
- For every non trivial X$\to$Y in F$^+$
  - X is super key
  - Or Y in primae attribute
