#### Recap
* **rename**
  - $\rho$ provide name to an expression $\rightarrow \rho_x(E)$
  - after rename, both new and old name can be used to access.
  - In SQL `AS` operation handles this. 

**Q**. Find the ID and name of those instructors who earn more than the instructor whose ID is 12121.
```SQL
    SELECT id,name FROM instructor WHERE salary >= (SELECT salary FROM instructor WHERE id=12121)
```
another ans $\downdownarrows$
```SQL
    SELECT i1.id,i1.name FROM instructor as i1, instructor as i2 WHERE i1.salary >= i2.salary and i2.id=12121
```
$\upuparrows$ much much slower and powerful?

* selecting smthng from a,b will internally create a big table of cross pdt of a and b.

### 5. Join
- cartesian pdt with a filtering condition $\Join_\theta$ applied on $R \cup S$
-  $R \Join_\theta S = \sigma_\theta (R \times S)$
-  comparative operators: `>`,`<`,`=`,`<>`
-  eg. $\text{instructor}\Join_{\text{instructor.id=teaches.id}}\text{teaches}$ 
- **Equijoin** : only equality condition is applied
   -  $\text{instructor}\Join_{\text{instructor.id=teaches.id}}\text{teaches}$ 
-  \*\*\* questions like who has highest salary without using aggregate functions are solved using ***join***. \*\*\*
- **Natural Join** : (AND) over equality conditions on all common attributes btw 2 tables.
   - $\text{instructor}\Join\text{teaches}$ 
- **Outer Join** : Allow NULL values in relation
  - combine relation with join predicate with an exception
    - keep tuples from a relation that does not match for the join condition
    - associate null values for the attributes in the other relation
  - left outer join: keep all tuples from left region
  - right outer join: keep all tuples from right region
