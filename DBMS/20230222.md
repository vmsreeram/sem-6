## Authorisation and Rules
- enable access to db
- privilege list
  - read : select
  - insert : insert
  - upd : update
  - del : delete
- type of actions: grant or revoke
```SQL
grant/revoke <privilege list>
on <relation/view>
to/from <users/roles>
```
- a (granted) user can pass auth to other users

- **role** is category, all the users with that role will get exactly similar access to db.
- when the admin create a user, the admin align the user to the appropriate role. so user automatically gets appropriate access to db.
- secure
- parially accessed by only some users

`**` for insertion,deletion,updation you have to give access to the base table along with giving access to view for it to work. selection may work without also.

## Transaction
- sequence of query and/or update statements
- implicitly mention the starting and ending point
  - `Commit()` : makes the update permanent in database
  - `Rollback()` : undo the last transaction and resore previous state
- Rollback does not work after execution of Commit.
- atomic property
- need to mention where it begin and where it ends

## Trigger
- method executed by dbms automatically in response to specific changes in database
  - event - insert, delete, or update (point of event - before/after)
  - condition
  - action - if condition is true
- Note: for selection no trigger is required, because no change.
