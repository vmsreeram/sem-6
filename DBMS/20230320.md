[Recap]
- BCNF (see slides : [lecture 4](*106105175/Week%204%20Lecture%20Material_watermark.pdf))
- Lossless Decomposition
- spurious tuple `?` 

## Dependency Preservation with F
- Enforce all FDs by checking decomposed relations
- algorithm (slide)
- `*` Attributes that can be derived using functional dependencies of a particular attribute is the $\textcolor{yellow}{\text{closure of that attribute}}$.
## Minimal Cover/Canonical Cover of F
..
- exactly opposite to closure of FDs.
- Remove extranous attribute
- eg. $AB\to C$, $A\to D$, $D\to C$ [$B$ is extraneous in $AB\to C$]
  - then minimal cover is ($A\to D$, $D\to C$)
- We can create table for each of these (minimal) FDs.

Algorithm for `Minimal Cover` is given in slides 20, 21.
- Remove extraneous attribute from left hand
- Remove extraneous attribute from right hand side
## Closure - Disadvantage
disadvantage whenever we apply F$^+$ : 
  - very inefficient
  - We apply `.?.` on every FD on F$^+$
