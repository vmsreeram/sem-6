## Merge Join
- sorted relation
- book algorithm is fine graned; longer
- pseudocode given in slide 10 is shortened version of it. «see slides»
- <u>Cost</u>: $b_s+b_r$ transfer; $\texttt{ceil}(b_s/b_b+b_r/b_b)$ seek

## Hash Join
- not sorted
- step1: partition $R$ and $S$ based on $h$. « in slide, $h$ is $\color{lightblue}{\texttt{key} \% 4}$ »
  - cost: $2 \times (b_r + b_s)$ transfer; 2 seek here 2 seek there (?) $= \texttt{ceil}(b_r/B_b + b_s/B_b)$
- step2: perform join on partition
  - $\text{build}\ \&\ \text{probe}$ 
- cost «see slides»
