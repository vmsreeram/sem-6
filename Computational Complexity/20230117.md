## Intro
- What is computation?
  - Whenever some sort of choice/decision is being made
  - Turing machine, GÃ¶del numbers, Lambda calculus }equivalent
- What can be computed?
  - Computability theory
  - Church Turing thesis : Algorithm $\equiv$ Turing Machine
- What can be efficiently computed?
  - Time : From giving input, how many steps it takes before it gives output.
  - Space
  - ***Computational Complexity***

* TMs can be encoded as strings
* Think of strings in $\Sigma ^*$ as turing machines
* $|\Sigma ^*|$ is countably infinite
* Set of all problems / languages $L \subseteq \Sigma ^*$ is uncountably infinite.
